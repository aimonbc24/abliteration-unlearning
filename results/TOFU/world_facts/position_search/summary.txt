Acc (pos -1): 0.33
Acc (pos -2): 0.33

Intervention at position -1 and position -2 both yielded unlearning accuracies of 0.33
The treatments performed the same on 42 of the questions.
Each treatment was successful in unlearning 12 questions that the other treatment was unsuccessful on, yielding 24 total discrepancies.

Despite seemingly comparable quantitative performance, the pos -1 treatment yielded more consistently fluent predictions, which is desirable. Generally, intervening at earlier positions yielded progressively less fluent predictions.
